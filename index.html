            <h2>What's In A Detail?</h2>
            <p>
                High-net-worth families are easily one of the most underprotected yet highly exposed groups in the
                digital age. They often live in a hybrid public-private world. Their financial power can create a false
                sense of protection. With legal structures, wealth managers, and estate planning professionals in place,
                families often believe their exposure has been “handled”. However, wealth doesn’t necessarily shield
                them from digital threats. In fact, it makes them more interesting to the wrong eyes. High-net-worth
                families can no longer rely on traditional privacy assumptions. Their digital presence is extensive,
                nuanced, and vulnerable in ways that they do not fully monitor or control.
                <br><br>
                Individually, each piece of publicly accessible information may appear trivial or harmless. A property
                record here, a social media post there, or a simple corporate filing may seem not to expose much on its
                own. However, danger hides in the aggregation. Adversaries use sophisticated methods to cross-reference
                and connect these disparate data points. When combined, they create a detailed, dynamic portrait of
                lifestyle, financial standing, relationships and behavioural patterns. This correlation effect makes
                seemingly benign information dangerous because it builds a contextual narrative about individuals and
                their family. It’s about what can be inferred and predicted by anyone with intent.
                <br><br>
                So, what’s in a detail? For our clients, the margin between safe and exposed.
